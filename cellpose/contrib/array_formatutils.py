def numpy_array_to_zarr(write_path, array, chunks):
    """
    Store an in memory numpy array to disk as a chunked Zarr array

    Parameters
    ----------
    write_path : string
        Filepath where Zarr array will be created

    array : numpy.ndarray
        The already loaded in-memory numpy array to store as zarr

    chunks : tuple, must be array.ndim length
        How the array will be chunked in the Zarr array

    Returns
    -------
    zarr.core.Array
        A read+write reference to the zarr array on disk

def wrap_folder_of_tiffs(
    filename_pattern,
    block_index_pattern=r'_(Z)(\d+)(Y)(\d+)(X)(\d+)',
):
    """
    Wrap a folder of tiff files with a zarr array without duplicating data.
    Tiff files must all contain images with the same shape and data type.
    Tiff file names must contain a pattern indicating where individual files
    lie in the block grid.

    Distributed computing requires parallel access to small regions of your
    image from different processes. This is best accomplished with chunked
    file formats like Zarr and N5. This function can accommodate a folder of
    tiff files, but it is not equivalent to reformating your data as Zarr or N5.
    If your individual tiff files/tiles are huge, distributed performance will
    be poor or not work at all.

    It does not make sense to use this function if you have only one tiff file.
    That tiff file will become the only chunk in the zarr array, which means all
    workers will have to load the entire image to fetch their crop of data anyway.
    If you have a single tiff image, you should just reformat it with the
    numpy_array_to_zarr function. Single tiff files too large to fit into system
    memory are not be supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename_pattern : string
        A glob pattern that will match all needed tif files

    block_index_pattern : regular expression string (default: r'_(Z)(\d+)(Y)(\d+)(X)(\d+)')
        A regular expression pattern that indicates how to parse tiff filenames
        to determine where each tiff file lies in the overall block grid
        The default pattern assumes filenames like the following:
            {any_prefix}_Z000Y000X000{any_suffix}
            {any_prefix}_Z000Y000X001{any_suffix}
            ... and so on
